      "Natural Language Prompts:",
      "• These prompts emulate human-like instructions, gurgling the form of natural language",
      "cues.",
      "• They allow developers to interact with the model more intuitively, using instructions",
      "that resemble how a person would communicate.",
      "System Prompts:",
      "• System prompts are predefined instructions or templates that developers provide to",
      "guide the model's output.",
      "• They offer a structured way of specifying the desired output format or behaviour,",
      "providing explicit instructions to the model.",
      "Conditional Prompts:",
      "• Conditional prompts involve conditioning the model on specific contexts or constraints.",
      "• By incorporating conditional prompts, developers can guide the model's behavior",
      "based on conditional statements, such as \"if X, then Y\" or \"Given A, generate B.\"",

      "Specifications to Definitely Include in an Effective Prompt",
      "To create the \"best\" prompt, experts consistently emphasize the following must-have elements:",
      "1. Clear Goal: State exactly what you want the AI to achieve (e.g., explain, generate,",
      "analyze). Ambiguity leads to vague outputs.",
      "2.",
      "Specific Role or Persona: Assign the AI a role (e.g., “act as a physicist”) to anchor its",
      "tone, expertise, and perspective.",
      "3.",
      "Detailed Context: Provide background information relevant to the task so the AI doesn’t",
      "guess or misinterpret your intent.",
      "4.",
      "Output Format: Define how the response should be structured (e.g., list, essay, table)",
      "to match your needs.",
      "5.",

      "maximizing relevance.",
      "Detailed Outline for Writing an Effective Prompt",
      "Here’s a step-by-step outline, grounded in expert-recommended techniques (e.g., OpenAI’s",
      "prompt engineering guides, the CLEAR framework by Dr. Leo Lo, and practical frameworks like",
      "RTF or CRAFT), to craft a prompt that an AI like ChatGPT will understand and use to output",
      "exactly what you want:",
      "1. Define the Goal",
      "● What to Do: Explicitly state the objective of the prompt. This is the “why” behind your",
      "request.",
      "●",
      "Why It Matters: Without a clear goal, the AI may provide generic or off-target",
      "responses.",
      "●",
      "How to Implement: Use action verbs (e.g., “explain,” “generate,” “compare”) and a",
      "concise purpose.",
      "●",
      "Example: “Generate a marketing plan” or “Explain quantum physics concepts.”",
      "●",
      "Tip: Ask yourself, “What’s the one thing I need from this response?”",
      "2. Assign a Role or Persona",
      "● What to Do: Tell the AI who it should “be” while responding (e.g., “You are a seasoned",
      "chef” or “Act as a data analyst”).",
      "●",
      "Why It Matters: This taps into the model’s training to mimic specific expertise or",
      "perspectives, improving accuracy and tone.",
      "●",
      "How to Implement: Start with a declarative statement assigning the role before the",
      "task.",
      "●",
      "Example: “You are an experienced SEO strategist.”",
      "●",
      "Tip: Choose a role that matches the domain knowledge required for your goal.",
      "3. Provide Context",
      "● What to Do: Give relevant background details to frame the task (e.g., audience,",
      "scenario, or prior information).",
      "●",
      "Why It Matters: Context prevents the AI from making assumptions or missing key",
      "nuances.",
      "●",
      "How to Implement: Include 1–2 sentences of specifics—dates, locations, stakeholders,",
      "or constraints.",
      "●",
      "Example: “The marketing plan is for a tech startup launching a new app in 2025,",
      "targeting young professionals.”",
      "●",
      "Tip: Imagine explaining the task to a smart colleague who lacks your specific situation—",
      "what would they need to know?",
      "4. Specify the Task",
      "● What to Do: Detail the exact action or deliverable you want, breaking it into clear steps if",
      "complex.",
      "●",
      "Why It Matters: Precision here ensures the AI focuses on your request, not tangents.",
      "●",
      "How to Implement: Use direct instructions and, if needed, list subtasks (e.g., “Include",
      "X, Y, Z”).",
      "●",
      "Example: “Write a 200-word blog post with three tips for app promotion, each with a",
      "catchy headline and a brief rationale.”",
      "●",
      "Tip: Avoid vague terms like “talk about” — opt for “list,” “describe,” or “analyze” instead.",
      "5. Set the Output Format",
      "● What to Do: Define how the response should look (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs, code",
      "block, table).",
      "●",
      "Why It Matters: This tailors the structure to your use case, making the output",
      "immediately usable.",
      "●",
      "How to Implement: State the format explicitly, including length if relevant.",
      "●",
      "Example: “Provide the response as a numbered list with each tip in 50 words or less.”",
      "●",
      "Tip: Match the format to how you’ll use it (e.g., a table for data comparison, prose for a",
      "narrative).",
      "6. Add Constraints and Guardrails",
      "● What to Do: Note what to avoid or include to refine the scope (e.g., “No sales jargon” or",
      "“Use only 2025 data”).",
      "●",
      "Why It Matters: This prevents irrelevant or unwanted content, keeping the AI on track.",
      "●",
      "How to Implement: Use phrases like “do not,” “only include,” or “limit to.”",
      "●",
      "Example: “Do not mention competitors by name; focus on general strategies.”",
      "●",
      "Tip: Anticipate common AI pitfalls (e.g., hallucination, verbosity) and preempt them.",
      "7. Specify Tone and Style",
      "● What to Do: Indicate the desired voice or complexity (e.g., “friendly and casual” or",
      "“technical and concise”).",
      "●",
      "Why It Matters: This ensures the response fits your audience or purpose, enhancing its",
      "effectiveness.",
      "●",
      "How to Implement: Add a short descriptor after the task.",
      "●",
      "Example: “Explain it in a supportive tone, as if speaking to a beginner.”",
      "●",
      "Tip: Test with adjectives like “professional,” “witty,” or “simple” to see what works best.",
      "8. Include Examples (Optional but Powerful)",
      "● What to Do: Provide a sample input/output pair to show the AI what success looks like.",
      "●",
      "Why It Matters: Examples clarify expectations, especially for creative or nuanced tasks,",
      "leveraging few-shot learning.",
      "●",
      "How to Implement: Add “For example: [input] → [desired output].”",
      "●",
      "Example: “For example: ‘Tip 1: Host a giveaway’ → ‘Tip 1: Host a Giveaway - Boost",
      "engagement with a fun contest.’”",
      "●",
      "Tip: Use this for complex tasks or when prior outputs missed the mark.",
      "9. Encourage Reasoning (Optional for Precision)",
      "● What to Do: Ask the AI to explain its logic or steps (e.g., “Show your reasoning”).",
      "●",
      "Why It Matters: This reduces errors and lets you verify the response’s validity.",
      "●",
      "How to Implement: Add a phrase like “step-by-step” or “justify your answer.”",
      "●",
      "Example: “List three strategies and explain why each works for this audience.”",
      "●",
      "Tip: Useful for technical or analytical tasks where process matters.",
      "10. Test and Refine",
      "● What to Do: Review the AI’s output and tweak the prompt if it’s off-target (e.g., add",
      "detail, adjust tone).",
      "●",
      "Why It Matters: LLMs aren’t perfect; iterative refinement hones the result.",
      "●",
      "How to Implement: Run the prompt, then modify based on gaps (e.g., “Make it shorter”",
      "or “Add more detail”).",
      "●",
      "Example: If the blog post is too long, add “Keep each tip under 50 words.”",
      "●",
      "Tip: Treat prompting like a conversation—adjust based on what you get back.",
